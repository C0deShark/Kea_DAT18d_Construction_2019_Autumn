A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.

The JVM gives each thread its own method-call stack. In addition to tracking the current byte code instruction, the method-call stack tracks local variables, parameters the JVM passes to a method, and the method's return value.

When multiple threads execute byte-code instruction sequences in the same program, that action is known as multithreading.

Why threads?
 - Multithreaded GUI: Non-blocking UI
 - Multi-core computer: Faster
 - Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.

However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area. They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.

Thread scheduling and the JVM
Most (if not all) JVM implementations use the underlying platform's threading capabilities. Because those capabilities are platform-specific, the order of your multithreaded programs' output might differ from the order of someone else's output. That difference results from scheduling.

Multitasking
    - Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)

    Each process has an address in memory. In other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.
    A process is heavyweight.
    Cost of communication between the process is high.
    Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps, updating lists, etc.

    - Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)

    Threads share the same address space.
    A thread is lightweight.
    Cost of communication between the thread is low.
